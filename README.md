# Microsoft Identity Integration

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Microsoft Identity** for authentication and authorization within an application. It follows best practices to ensure security, scalability, and maintainability, providing a robust foundation for integrating identity management into modern web applications.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Uses Microsoft Identity for secure login and authentication, ensuring that users can sign in using their Microsoft accounts or Azure AD credentials.
- **Authorization**: Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) and claims-based authorization to secure application resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Integrated MFA for enhanced security, ensuring users are protected with an additional layer of verification.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enabled SSO functionality for users, providing seamless access across multiple applications within the same organization.
- **Secure Token Service**: Utilizes OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for issuing and validating secure tokens.
  
## Best Practices Followed

- **Secure Storage**: Uses secure mechanisms to store sensitive information such as client secrets and tokens.
- **Least Privilege**: Enforces the principle of least privilege for user access, ensuring users have only the necessary permissions.
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens are set to expire after a short time to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Delegated Permissions**: Where appropriate, delegated permissions are used to grant limited access to resources on behalf of users.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Identity Platform**: For authentication and authorization.
- **ASP.NET Core**: The backend framework for the application.
